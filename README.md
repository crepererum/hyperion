#hyperion [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crepererum/hyperion.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/crepererum/hyperion) [![Requirements Status](https://requires.io/github/crepererum/hyperion/requirements.png?branch=master)](https://requires.io/github/crepererum/hyperion/requirements/?branch=master)
This provides modern LaTeX classes, workflow information and useful utilities. It contains the following parts:

 - **autotex** a modern TeX compilation tool
 - **classes** the actual LaTeX classes
 - **unicode** unicode symbol macros
 - **random** everything else

##Requirements
Apart from a modern TeX distribution like [TeX Live 2013](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) some parts require [Python 3.3 or higher](https://www.python.org/) to work.

##Documentation
Sometimes, the documentation is not directly included and has to be generated or compiled using LaTeX. Please refer the README files of the subprojects for more information.
